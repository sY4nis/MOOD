                            I know this sounds like a stupid name, but listen i did this game with amount impressive amount of zero hours of sleep in my blood. I didn't really know where to start as a gamedev and so i decided to make the most basic idle game i can imagine. GCCC is an idle game where the goal is to unlock the amazing Nekofee skin ! You can buy a tiny robot that will meow for you each seconds, and you can also buy severals multipliers that will help you reaching your achivement faster.<br>
